TOPIC -- Converting the pdf files into markdown files using Gemini

DATE - 03-06-25 
I have done project setup.
I have created two folders Input-files_pdfs and Input-files_converted-md. And in the folder Input-files_pdfs i have added three pdfs. 
These pdf can be later converted in markdown file.

I have installed some extra libraries like --
1. PyMuPDF - It is used for reading and extracting text from pdf.
2. python-dotenv - To load the API key from .env
3. PyPDF2 - Used for PDF reading
And list out all the libraries installed in the environment using pip list command.

I have created a new file (.env) in root directory for storing API key
.env = .env is a hidden environment file used to store sensitive information like API keys 
(e.g., Gemini API key)
Database credentials
Secret tokens

Created 2 more files inside Secret
1. converter.py - extract text from pdf
2. gemini_helper.py - to securely fetch api and logic to convert text into markdown
and understand the concept of using these files.

Basic PDF Extraction in main.py - Added PDF reading and text extraction logic in main.py
Wrote basic code in main.py to ---
1. Load a single PDF (Ikigai.pdf) using PyPDF2.
2. Extract text from all pages.
3. Print the full extracted content to console.
I have done this to verify that PDF reading and text extraction using PyPDF2 is working correctly.

Modify the code by moving PDF extraction logic to converter.py

I have created a new file converter.py
Moved the extract_text_from_pdf(filename) function from main.py to converter.py.
Updated main.py to import the function from converter.py.
This is done to maintain cleaner, modular code and don't make it look messy.
