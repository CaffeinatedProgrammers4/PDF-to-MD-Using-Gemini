TOPIC -- Converting the pdf files into markdownfiles using Gemini

DATE - 03-06-25 
I have done project setup.
I have created two folders Input-files_pdfs and Input-files_converted-md. And in the folder Input-files_pdfs i have added three pdfs. 
These pdf can be later converted in markdown file.

I have installed some extra libraries like --
1. PyMuPDF - It is used for reading and extracting text from pdf.
2. python-dotenv - To load the API key from .env
3. PyPDF2 - Used for PDF reading
And list out all the libraries installed in the environment using pip list command.

DATE - 05-06-25
I have created a new file (.env) in root directory for storing API key
.env = .env is a hidden environment file used to store sensitive information like API keys 
(e.g., Gemini API key)
Database credentials
Secret tokens

Created 2 more files inside Secret
1. converter.py - extract text from pdf
2. gemini_helper.py - to securely fetch api and logic to convert text into markdown
and understand the concept of using these files.

Created Gemini API and test it using genrativeai module.

I have import PyPDF2 library which is used to deal with pdf files. 
It can perform task like read, extract text, merge, split, rotate pages, and perform other operations on PDF documents.
It reads the pdf file from given folder and extract all the text from it.
